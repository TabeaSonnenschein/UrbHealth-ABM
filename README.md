# UrbHealth-ABM: Urban Health Scenario Agent-based Model

This repository (or script) contains an **Agent-Based Model (ABM)** that simulates individual-level actvity schedules, mobility choices, resulting traffic and air pollution  and exposure to air pollution and transport related physical activity under different urban scenarios.  This repository contains the ABM model and input data used for the paper "Discovering environmental health effects of transport scenarios through agent-based simulations" published by Environment International. We are planning on adding our data and model input preparation scripts and the output analysis scripts at a later stage.

## 1. Overview

This ABM simulates:

- **Human agents** with demographic attributes, daily schedules, and location-based activities (e.g., work, school, shopping).
- **Travel decisions** (mode choice, routes) based on environmental attributes and personal demographics.
- **Traffic density** on road networks derived from aggregated individual travel.
- **Air pollution levels (NO2)**, calculated from a hybrid dispersion model that uses baseline concentration, traffic volume, and built-environment features.
- **Exposure** of each agent to hourly NO2 concentrations, differentiating between indoor/outdoor exposure.

It leverages real-world data (e.g., geospatial building footprints, road networks, travel patterns, demographic data) to simulate within the Amsterdam region (or your chosen city).

---

## 2. Key Features

- **Simultaneous Activation** of agents (via [Mesa's `SimultaneousActivation`](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/apis/time.html)).
- **OSRM-based routing** for bike, drive, walk, or transit modes.  
- **Conditional route reuse** (caching of frequently traveled routes).
- **Hourly traffic assignment** to a grid, with optional regression-based or remainder-based approaches to match observed traffic.
- **hybrid dispersion** calculations for NO2 considering meteorological and morphological dispersion moderators, using cellular automata (via `CellAutDisp`).
- **Personal Exposure** to NO2 (depending on activity and mobility patterns) and transport physical activity
- **Scenario-based** interventions (e.g., no-emission zones, 15-minute city, increased parking fees).
- **Parallelization** with Python’s `multiprocessing` to handle large agent sets efficiently.

> **Note**: This structure is illustrated in the script. You need to adapt `path_data` for the paths to the Repository.
---

## 7. Setting up local OSRM instance

Find the instructions in `SETUP_OSRM_README.md`.

---

## 8. Usage

1. **Set path to repository** : Set `path_data` to the path to the repository
1. **Configure the Simulation Settings**: Edit the parameters at the bottom of the script (e.g., `nb_humans`, `modelname`, `TraffStage`, `starting_date`, etc.) to configure your simulation run. See next section for instructions.
2. **Ensure** OSRM servers are running. The script calls a batch file `start_OSRM_Servers.bat` to start local OSRM instances for `bike`, `car`, and `foot` profiles on ports `5001`, `5000`, and `5002`.  
   - You may need to adapt or create your own `.bat` scripts for your OSRM setup.
3. **Run** the script:
   ```bash
   python ABMScripts/TransportScenarioABM.py
   ```
4. **Monitor** logs and outputs. Various CSV files, shapefiles, or figures are saved into the `ModelRuns/...` subdirectories.

---
## 9. Customization & Scenarios

Scenario parameters:
- `modelname`  indicates the type of scenario you are testing:  
  - **`"StatusQuo"`**: Baseline city conditions.  
  - **`"PrkPriceInterv"`**: Example scenario with changed parking price variables.  
  - **`"15mCity"`** or **`"15mCityWithDestination"`**: Where destinations (work, shops) might be forced within 15 minutes from home.  
  - **`"NoEmissionZone2025/2030"`**: Vehicle-based restrictions if the user does not have electric car access.

- `nb_humans` to control how many agents are simulated (from ~1% to 10% of the real population).
- `newpop` (boolean) indicates whether you want to create a new sample of the total population based on the `nb_humans`
- `subsetnr` only is used if `newpop = False` and indicates the existing subsample of the population to be used (we have 10 existing samples that are used for each scenario for Monte Carlo simulation)


- `starting_date` used the datetime structure to set the real world time starting point (e.g. `datetime(2019, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)`)
- The simulation extent can be changed via `NrDays`, `NrMonths`, `NrHours` and `MonthsStep`. The simulation timestep is 10 minutes. But how many hours per day, how many days per months and how many months and with which months step are modeled is determined using these parameters. The default is 24h (full day), 7 days (a week), 4 months but with a MonthsStep of 3 (so every 3rd months is modeled).

- `TraffStage`: Can be used to calculate the Traffic Assignment  model based on the Status Quo synthetic population traffic behavior. 
  - `"Regression"` – Uses a linear regression approach to match assigned vs. observed traffic.  
  - `"Remainder"` – Stores partial differences in traffic for subsequent hours.  
  - `"PredictionNoR2"` or `"PredictionR2"` – A final forecast step with or without R² logging.

- `crs` set the Coordinate Reference system. Default is RDNew  `epsg:28992`(appropriate for the Netherlands)

- `cellsize` is the grid cellsize of the Air Pollution and Traffic Grids (default set to 50mx50m) using `cellsize = 50`

## 10. Script Structure & Main Components

### A) **Agent Class: `Humans`**
- Inherits from `mesa.Agent`.
- Manages:
  - **Demographics** (education, age, car ownership, etc.)
  - **Activity schedules** (from the `HETUS2010_Synthpop_schedulesclean_*.csv`).
  - **Mode choice** via a pre-trained PMML Random Forest classifier.
  - **Travel routing** using OSRM-based polylines, or fallback to Euclidean if OSRM fails.
  - **Exposure** to NO2, separated into indoor/outdoor fractions.

### B) **Model Class: `TransportAirPollutionExposureModel`**
- Inherits from `mesa.Model`.
- Manages:
  - **Agent creation** (the synthetic population).
  - **Global schedule** (hourly steps).
  - **Traffic assignment** on a grid for each hour, merging agent travel to produce aggregated road usage.
  - **Hybrid dispersion model** that takes traffic volumes and calculates updated NO2 in each grid cell.
  - **Logging** of outputs: agent exposures, travel modes, or pollution maps.

### C) **Helper Functions**
- `worker_process` / `hourly_worker_process`: Parallel step functions to update agents.
- `TraffSpatialJoint()`: Spatial join logic that counts how many routes intersect each grid cell.
- `RetrieveRoutes()`, `RetrieveExposure()`, etc.: Helper data collection from sub-sets of agents.

### D) **Scenario Logic & Parameter Flags**
- `modelname`: determines scenario (e.g., *StatusQuo*, *PrkPriceInterv*, *15mCity*, *NoEmissionZone2025*, etc.).
- `TraffStage`: decides how traffic volumes are calculated (e.g., *"Regression"*, *"Remainder"*, *"PredictionNoR2"*, etc.).
- `nb_humans`: total agents simulated.
- `starting_date`: simulation start date.
- `NrDays`, `NrHours`, `NrMonths`: length of simulation. 
- More advanced parameters in the bottom block.

---

## 11. Performance & Parallelization

- Uses **`multiprocessing.Pool`** to distribute agent steps and traffic assignment across multiple cores.  
- The variable `n = os.cpu_count() - 4` (by default) reserves some cores for system tasks. Adapt as necessary.  
- Large runs can be **memory-intensive**. You may need ample RAM if you simulate many agents or large geographies.  
- For further optimization, you can **profile** the code with the `profile = True` option (using `cProfile`).

---

## 12. Troubleshooting

1. **OSRM Connection Errors**  
   - Ensure OSRM servers are running at the expected ports (5000, 5001, 5002).  
   - Adjust the server URL in the `Routing()` method if you are running OSRM on another machine or ports.

2. **Missing Data Files**  
   - Verify that all CSV, feather, or raster data are correctly placed.  
   - Adjust `path_data` if needed.

3. **Memory Errors**  
   - Reduce `nb_humans` or the number of steps (days, hours).  
   - Increase system swap or run on a machine with more RAM.

4. **Coordinate Reference System Issues**  
   - Double check that your data are indeed in the same `epsg:28992` projection (or adapt the code if not).
